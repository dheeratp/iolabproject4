<h1>Visualizations with Last.fm</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>With so much music available, finding new music that you like can be like finding a needle in a haystack. We need new tools to help us to explore the world of music, tools that can help us separate the wheat from the chaff. In this panel we will look at how visualizations can be used to help people explore the music space and discover new, interesting music that they will like. We will look at a wide range of visualizations, from hand drawn artist maps, to highly interactive, immersive 3D environments. We'll explore a number of different visualization techniques including graphs, trees, maps, timelines and flow diagrams and we'll examine different types of music data that can contribute to a visualization. Using numerous examples drawn from commercial and research systems we'll show how visualizations are being used now to enhance music discovery and we'll demonstrate some new visualization techniques coming out of the labs that we'll find in tomorrow's music discovery applications.</p>

We study the social structure of Facebook "friendship" networks at one hundred American colleges and universities at a single point in time, 
and we examine the roles of user attributes - gender, class year, major, high school, 
and residence - at these institutions. 
We investigate the influence of common attributes at the dyad level in terms of 
assortativity coefficients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings 
by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based 
on the user characteristics. We thereby compare the relative importances of different 
characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school 
is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance 
of common major varies significantly between institutions. Our calculations illustrate 
how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the social 
organization at universities and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further.

More importantly, websites such as Musicovery (the original interface) and TuneGlue use information visualisation to enhance music discovery through network maps– using nodes and links from one artist to another. Musicovery interestingly uses colour to distinguish categories of music according to mood. Calm vs. Energetic, Dark vs. Positive.</p>
<p>
The first question is: why should we visualise music at all?</p>
<p>
Music is not visual after all. But when there are millions of songs, it is useful to have some tools to help with this process of discovery. Recommendation and playlists, through visualisation. Visualisations can “tell a story, and engage our pattern-matching brain” (Donaldson & Lamere, ISMIR 2009).
</p>
<p>The second question is: how should we best visualise music discovery?</p>
<p>
Long debates have taken place regarding music categorisation through Genre, as this is a very subjective matter.</p>
<p>
The work of Schedl, Pohle, Knees and Widmer (2006) assigned and visualised music genres through co-occurrences of artist and genre names on music-related web pages and uses a probabilistic model to predict the genre of an arbitrary artist.
</p>
<p>
The work of Mörchen, Ultsch, Thies, Löhken, Nöcker, Stamm, Efthymiou and Kümmerer (2005) analysed and visualised timbre similarities of sound within a music collection. They argue there are many problems with genre classification:
</p>
<p>
The problem with this approach is the subjectivity and ambiguity of the categorization used for training and validation [Aucouturier and Pachet, 2003]. Often genres don’t even correspond to the sound of the music but to the time and place where the music came up or the culture of the musicians creating it. Some authors try to explain the low performance of their classi_cation methods by the fuzzy and overlapping nature of genres [Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002]. An analysis of musical similarity showed bad correspondence with genres, again explained by their inconsistency and ambiguity [Pampalk et al., 2003b].</p>

<p>Our app is catered to users (mostly music lovers and music trend analysts) who are interested to know what people in popular metros are listening to.</p>
